<h1 id="about-me">About Me</h1>

<h2 style="margin: 80px 0px 10px;"></h2>

<div style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">
I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the [School of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.gatech.edu/) at the [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/) in Atlanta, advised by [Dr. Saibal Mukhopadhyay](https://ece.gatech.edu/people/saibal-mukhopadhyay). My research focuses on developing simulation frameworks and design tools for quantum sensors aimed at low-power and precision-based applications. Currently, I am exploring controlled feedback-based quantum tomography techniques to enhance quantum state preparation, thereby improving the performance of quantum photonic sensors. I have integrated metaheuristic algorithms with the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) and benchmarked the outcomes against quantum annealing methods. These findings were presented at the [Quantum Information Processing (QIP) 2024 Conference](https://qip2024.tw/) in Taipei and the [Science and Information Conference](https://saiconference.com/Computing) in London.

My work includes the development of innovative Quantum Long Short-Term Memory (QLSTM) and Quantum Vision Transformer (Quantum ViT) models for applications in healthcare and security. I have also implemented novel quantum-based heuristic algorithms to optimize these model parameters. My research has been featured in prominent journals and conferences, including [IGARSS](https://www.igarss.org/), [IJCNN](https://www.ijcnn.org/), [IJCAI](https://www.ijcai.org/), [SSCI](https://ieeessci2024.org/), [IJCCI](https://ijcci.scitevents.org/), [Multimedia Tools and Applications](https://www.springer.com/journal/11042), and [Studies in Computational Intelligence](https://www.springer.com/series/7092).

<strong style="color:#e74d3c; font-weight:600"> Looking ahead, my research will focus on hardware-classical hardware co-design for photonic quantum sensors. My objective is to develop precise and energy-efficient sensing methods that leverage the capabilities of emerging quantum technologies. I aim to apply these skills in a dynamic research environment to solve challenging research problems. </strong>

<strong style="color:#e74d3c; font-weight:600">I am actively seeking collaborations and opportunities in the fields of quantum sensing, quantum machine learning, and hardware co-design. Please feel free to reach out to discuss potential research collaborations or opportunities.</strong>
